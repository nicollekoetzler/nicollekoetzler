# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ ~~General Kenobi~~ ðŸ¤–
<p align="left">My name is Nicolle and I'm a <strong>Front End Developer</strong> and <strong>Full Stack Designer</strong> from Brazil!</p>

### Some facts about me:
<p align="left">
  ðŸ’¬  I speak Portuguese (my native language), English (advanced), and I am begginer in <strong>Japanese</strong>.<br>
  âœ¨  Values are very important to me, so I like to reflect and understand other points of view before making decisions.<br>
  ðŸ“š  I have more than 10 years of experience in Adobe Photoshop ðŸ’»<br>
  ðŸŽ¸  I work with <strong>"Prog"</strong> and my biggest hobbie is listening to <strong>"Prog"</strong>. That is to say, I'm a Programmer who loves Progressive Rock. There's nothing better than coding for hours with a great progressive song!

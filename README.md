# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ ~~General Kenobi~~
<p align="left">My name is Nicolle and I'm a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> from Brazil!</p>
<p align="left">I'm a open minded and creative person, I'm always searching new and better possibilities.</p>

### Some facts about me:

- ðŸ’¬ I speak Portuguese (my native language), English (advanced), and I am begginer in **Japanese**.
- âœ¨ Values are very important to me, so I like to reflect and understand other points of view before making decisions.
- ðŸ“š I have almost 10 years of experience in Adobe Photoshop and three in Adobe Illustrator ðŸ’»
- ðŸŽ¸ I work with **"Prog"** and my biggest hobbie is listening to **"Prog"**. That is to say, I'm a Programmer who loves Progressive Rock.
There's nothing better than coding for hours with a great progressive song!
